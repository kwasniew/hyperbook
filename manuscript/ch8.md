# Chapter 8: Modeling state

## Handling slow API

Switch `SavePost` to a new url with the slow API.
```js
const SavePost = (post) =>
  Http({
    url: "http://hyperapp-api.herokuapp.com/slow-api/post",
    ...
  });
```
When you test the app `SavePost` should take about 3 seconds before a notification arrives. 
While waiting for the response, you can send more requests without getting confirmation that the previous ones succeeded. 
Confused users may try to add the same message again thinking that something went wrong. Disable the **Add Post** button while the post is saving.

Enhance initial state with the `isSaving` property.
```js
const state = {
  currentPostText: "",
  posts: [],
  liveUpdate: true,
  isSaving: false
};
```

Map the property to the button `disable` property:
```js
<button onclick=${AddPost} disabled=${state.isSaving}>Add Post</button>
```
The button reflects the current state of the saving operation.

`AddPost` action disables the button:
```js
const AddPost = (state) => {
    ...
    const newState = {
      ...state,
      currentPostText: "",
      isSaving: true,
    };
    ...
};
```

`SavePost` action enables the button after a successful response.
You need a new `PostSaved` action to be called after the post is saved:
```js
const PostSaved = (state) => ({ ...state, isSaving: false });

const SavePost = (post) =>
  Http({
    ...
    action: PostSaved,
  });
```

Test if your version of the button works as intended.

## Handling API errors

Switch `SavePost` to a new url with API returning error responses.
```js
const SavePost = (post) =>
  Http({
    url: "http://hyperapp-api.herokuapp.com/error-api/post",
    ...
  });
```
The new API is not only slow but also returns 500 errors.

Enhance initial state with the `error` property:
```js
const state = {
  currentPostText: "",
  posts: [],
  liveUpdate: true,
  isSaving: false,
  error: ""
};
```
Eventually, you will populate this field with an error value.

Expose the `error` in the UI:
```js
<div>${state.error}</div>
```
You should put the error just above the **Add Post**  button and the input field.

Add `PostError` action that will be triggered on HTTP errors. 
```js
const PostSaved = state => ({
  ...state,
  isSaving: false
});
const PostError = state => ({
  ...state,
  isSaving: false, 
  error: "Post cannot be saved."
});

const SavePost = (post) =>
  Http({
    ...
    action: PostSaved,
    error: PostError
  });
```
`PostError` should enable the **Add Post** button and set the error message.

Add error handling in your `fetchEffect`:
```js
const fetchEffect = (dispatch, data) => {
  return window
    .fetch(data.url, data.options)
    .then((response) => (response.ok ? response : Promise.reject(response.json())))
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((json) => {
      return dispatch(data.action, json);
    })
    .catch((e) => dispatch(data.error, e));
};
```
`window.fetch` API doesn't reject a promise by default. We have to inspect the `response` object and trigger promise rejection
ourselves. 

Test your application.

You should see an error after the post submission. 
However, even if the post succeeded the second time, the error won't disappear. 
We'd expect the error to disappear at some point, for example when you start typing a new message.
You can change `SetPost` action to remove the error message, but there is a better way to model our state.

## Modeling only valid states

Take a look at the last two fields you added to the state:
```js
const state = {
  ...
  isSaving: false,
  error: ""
};
```

Those 2 states have 4 possible combinations:
* `isSaving: false` and `error: ""` (request is idle, user is typing a new message)
* `isSaving: false` and `error: "Post cannot be saved."` (request error after form submission)
* `isSaving: true` and `error: ""` (request is pending)
* `isSaving: true` and `error: "Post cannot be saved."` (**should be impossible**)

The last combination should be impossible. But the way we modeled our state makes it possible. 
Of course, you can write some tests to verify the combination never occurs. But you can also model your state to **make the impossible state impossible**.

The request status can be in 1 of 3 valid states:
* `{status: "idle"}`
* `{status: "pending"}`
* `{status: "error", message: "Post cannot be saved."}`

## Implementing only valid states

Introduce 3 valid states we defined in the modeling exercise and set the `idle` status as the initial one.
```js
const idle = { status: "idle" };
const saving = { status: "saving" };
const error = {
  status: "error",
  message: "Post cannot be saved.",
};
const state = {
  currentPostText: "",
  posts: [],
  liveUpdate: true,
  requestStatus: idle,
};
```
A common strategy to scale a growing state object is to split it into smaller objects and combine them.

Find all the places where you were setting `isSaving` and `error` properties and replace them with `requestStatus`. 

`AddPost` sets the status to `saving`:
```js
const AddPost = (state) => {
    ...
    const newState = {
      ...state,
      currentPostText: "",
      requestStatus: saving
    };
    ...
};
```

`PostSaved` sets the status to `idle`:
```js
const PostSaved = (state) => ({ ...state, requestStatus: idle });
```

`PostError` sets the status to `error`:
```js
const PostError = (state) => ({ ...state, requestStatus: error });
```

Map request error message in the new `errorMessage` view fragment:
```js
const errorMessage = ({ message }) => html`<div>${message}</div>`;
```
Map request status to the button `disabled` status in the new `addPostButton` view fragment:
```js
const addPostButton = ({ status }) => html`
  <button onclick=${AddPost} disabled=${status === "saving"}>Add Post</button>
`;
```

Delete those two lines:
```js
<div>${state.error}</div>
<button onclick=${AddPost} disabled=${state.isSaving}>Add Post</button>
```

And replace them with your new view fragments:
```js
${errorMessage(state.requestStatus)}
${addPostButton(state.requestStatus)}
```
A common strategy to scale growing view functions is to split them into smaller view fragments and delegate to them.

## Exercise: removing error when typing a new post

Modify the ```UpdatePostText``` action to remove the error message when a user starts typing a new post.

<details>
    <summary id="cleaning_text_input">Solution</summary>

```js
const UpdatePostText = (state, currentPostText) => ({
  ...state,
  currentPostText,
  requestStatus: idle
});
```

</details>

Now revert your API `url` in `SavePost` to `"http://hyperapp-api.herokuapp.com/api/post"`
